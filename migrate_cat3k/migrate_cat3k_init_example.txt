#This is a sample Catalyst migration initialization file with device mappings for migrate_cat3k.py
#
#Syntax:
# * Blank lines and lines only containing whitespace will be ignored.
# * Use lines beginning with # as comments. These lines will be ignored.
# * Use "net=Network_name" to define a network. A network definition line must exist before any
#    device definition lines.
# * Device definition lines. These lines define the IP address of the original Catalyst switch, 
#    the Meraki MS switch serial number the configuration will be transferred to and optionally
#    a SSH username and password to log into the Catalyst device. If username and password are
#    omitted, default credentials will be used. These lines can have four forms:
#        <device_ip> <serial_number>
#        <device_ip> <serial_number> <username> <password>
#        file <filename> <serial_number>
# * File names should contain spaces
# * To migrate a multi-linecard switch or a switch stack, separate their serial numbers with commas, leaving no spaces between them
#
